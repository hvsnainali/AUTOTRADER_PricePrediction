# Machine Learning for Car Sale Adverts

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning solution for predicting the selling prices of cars based on their characteristics. The project is part of the Machine Learning Concepts unit, providing students with a real-world, industry-based problem-solving experience.

## Project Tasks

- **Data Understanding, Exploration, Cleaning, and Preparation:**
  - Analyze the Car Sale Adverts dataset provided by AutoTrader.
  - Explore and understand the features, including brand, type, color, mileage, and selling price.
  - Clean the data, handle missing values, and prepare it for machine learning tasks.

- **Machine Learning Model Development:**
  - Select and implement appropriate machine learning models for regression.
  - Tune and optimize the selected models for better performance.
  - Fit the models to the training data and evaluate their performance.

- **Report and Documentation:**
  - Produce a structured report documenting the entire machine learning process.
  - Highlight insights gained from the analysis and model evaluation.

## Dataset

The project utilizes a Car Sale Adverts dataset provided by AutoTrader, containing anonymized information about vehicles, including brand, type, color, mileage, and selling price. The goal is to build a regression model that accurately predicts the selling price based on these features.

## Conclusion

The purpose of this project is to illustrate an all-encompassing approach to predictive modelling by putting an emphasis on feature engineering, model selection, and ensemble approaches. It not only offers useful insights into the realm of automobile pricing, but it also acts as a platform for future expansions and applications.
